                <h1><strong> About Us</strong></h1>
                <p>We are a small CFA (Cat Fanciers Association - JJmaineCoons) registered Maine Coon cattery located in
                    Houston, TX. Our beautiful cats and kittens are part of the family, very well-socialized, and given
                    lots of love and affection. Our cats are free to roam in and outside via a cat door. We have built
                    an outdoor netted cat play area that is 30ft x 20ft and 10ft tall where the cats can run, climb, and
                    play.

                <h1><strong>About Our Cats</strong></h1>
                <p>
                    Our cats are accustomed to riding in our cars, usually choosing to lounge looking out the front
                    window as we drive. Our Cats are used to being around dogs and lots of kids. Our goal is to produce
                    healthy and beautiful Maine Coon kittens that make wonderful companions. Our kittens can be adopted
                    at 12 weeks of age.

                <h1><strong> Responsible Breeding</strong></h1>
                <p>
                    Our Mom and Dad cats are healthy and fully vaccinated. Each visits the vet annually and as required.
                    Additionally, our cats are genetically clear of over 40 genetic health markers. To ensure we
                    maintain a diverse gene pool. Specifically, we track at least a 5-generation lineage so that none of
                    our males are related to any of the females.
                </p>
